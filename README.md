Discussions on these scripts sometimes take place on the [musicbrainz forums](https://community.metabrainz.org/tags/userscripts).

Notes

Warning: those scripts are developed for my own use! I expect them to be
useless for other people, except as an example to adapt to your own goals.
Contributions and feedback are welcome.
